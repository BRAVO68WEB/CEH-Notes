# CEH v12 Expereince

I recently passed the CEH v12 exam and wanted to share my experience with the community. I have been to cyber security for past 7 months. I have been regularly practicing on HackTheBox. 

## Exam Preparation

I started my preparation by making my basics strong about common vulnerabilities and exploits.

I used the following resources for my preparation:

**CEH v12 Official Courseware**: I went through the official courseware provided by EC-Council. It is a good resource to start with.

## Exam Notes

- [New.md](New.md)
- [Old.md](Old.md)

## Exam Experience

The exam was of 6 hours and I was able to complete it in 3 hours. The exam was not very difficult but it was tricky. I had to think out of the box for some questions.

> **Note**: I would recommend to practice on HackTheBox and VulnHub before appearing for the exam. Also, don't you dare use keyboard shortcuts during the exam, as some of them, might lead to unexpected results. Like, I used `Ctrl + W` to search in nano, and it closed the exam tab. I had to restart the exam.

## Conclusion

I am happy that I passed the exam. I would recommend to practice more and more before appearing for the exam. Also, make sure you have a good night sleep before the exam.
